# hawkwatchers

__hawkwatchers__ is an interface allowing users to predict fluctuations in the US Federal interest rate based on the text of press releases.

## Getting Started
__hawkwatchers__ runs on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and makes use of a variety of [Python 3.6](https://docs.python.org/3/) packages.

1. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
2. [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
3. [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
4. [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/)
5. [pyenchant](https://github.com/rfk/pyenchant)
6. [beautiful_soup](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4)
7. [urllib3](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The following built-in modules are also used: sys, re, math, csv

All requisite packages can be installed as such:
```
$ pip install [package name]
```


## Authors
- Elena Badillo Goicoechea
- Natasha Mathur
- Joseph Denby

We are graduate students in the [CAPP](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) and [MACSS](https://macss.uchicago.edu/) programs at the University of Chicago. 

TODO:

- add instructions for:
    + scraping links/texts
    + nltk processing
    + scikit learn
    + nn_model
- add data cleaning code / description 

## Note on Modified Code

Code from outside sources was used in the following contexts and manners:

Web Scraping: We used the following util functions from files provided in course 
CAPP 30122 as part of PA #2.
 - util.read_request()
 - util.get_request()
 
Text Processing: . . . . . 

Website Construction:
 - We utilized code generated by Django  . . . . 
 - When creating the web pages we used code snippets from a [Bootstrap template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/cover/). 


## Data Collection

### Web Scraping

release_scraping.py (Elena and Natasha) (Heavily Modified)
release_scraping_hist.py (Elena) (Heavily Modified)
util.py (Direct copy)

### Interest Rate collection

all_rates.xslx (Natasha) (Original)

### Combined Data

The data is consolidated in the following dataframes that were used to run the models. 

allratesdf.csv (Joseph) (Original)
allreleaserates.csv (Joseph) (Original)
allreleasescleaned.csv (Joseph) (Original)

## Model Construction

nltk_processing.ipynb (Joseph) (Heavily Modified)

The above file contains the code to organize the dataframes as well as several modeling techniques we did not end up using. 
The consolidated code is in the below file:

hawkwatchers/hawksite/hawk_tracker/nn_model.py
