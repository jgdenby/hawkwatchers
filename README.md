# hawkwatchers

__hawkwatchers__ is an interface allowing users to predict fluctuations in the US Federal interest rate based on the text of press releases.

## Getting Started
__hawkwatchers__ runs on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and makes use of a variety of [Python 3.6](https://docs.python.org/3/) packages.

1. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
2. [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
3. [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
4. [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/)
5. [pyenchant](https://github.com/rfk/pyenchant)
6. [beautiful_soup](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4)
7. [urllib3](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The following built-in modules are also used: sys, re, math, csv

All requisite packages can be installed as such:
```
$ pip install [package name]
```

We are graduate students in the [CAPP](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) and [MACSS](https://macss.uchicago.edu/) programs at the University of Chicago. 

TODO:

- add instructions for:
    + scraping links/texts
    + nltk processing
    + scikit learn
    + nn_model
- add data cleaning code / description 

## Note on Modified Code

Code from outside sources was used in the following contexts and manners:

Web Scraping: We used the following util functions from files provided in course CAPP 30122 as part of PA #2.
 - util.read_request()
 - util.get_request()
 
Text Processing: . . . . . 

Website Construction:
 - We utilized code generated by Django  . . . . 
 - When creating the web pages we used code snippets from a [Bootstrap template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/cover/). 


## Data Collection

### Web Scraping

The press releases used were scraped from the Federal Reserve website. The releases are located in different locations and in different formats for 2013 - 2018 and for pre-2013. As such, there are separate web scrapers and starting urls.

### Rate Sources

The effective federal funds rate was downloaded from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' website. There is a period of time when the interest rate does not change. For that time range, the shadow interest rate calculated by Wu/Xia was use. It was  downloaded from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta website.

The Labor Market Conditions Index was used to create a counterpoint to our model. The data was downloaded from the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Kansas City' website.

### Combined Data

The data is consolidated in the following dataframes that were used to run the models.

The above notebook contains the code to organize the dataframes as well as several modeling techniques we did not end up using. 
The consolidated code is in the below file:
