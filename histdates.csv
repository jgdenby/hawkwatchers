The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.  Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually.  Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal.

5,"September 20, 2005","For immediate releaseThe Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3-3/4 percent.	Output appeared poised to continue growing at a good pace before the tragic toll of Hurricane Katrina.  The widespread devastation in the Gulf region, the associated dislocation of economic activity, and the boost to energy prices imply that spending, production, and employment will be set back in the near term.  In addition to elevating premiums for some energy products, the disruption to the production and refining infrastructure may add to energy price volatility.	While these unfortunate developments have increased uncertainty about near-term economic performance, it is the Committee's view that they do not pose a more persistent threat.  Rather, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.  Higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures.  However, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.	The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.

The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.  After moderating earlier this year partly in response to the substantial rise in energy prices, output growth appears to have regained some traction, and labor market conditions have improved modestly.  Despite the rise in energy prices, inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months.    	The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.

Last fall the Committee reduced interest rates to counter a significant seizing-up of financial markets in the United States.

Accordingly, the full degree of adjustment is judged no longer necessary.	Labor markets have continued to tighten over recent quarters, but strengthening productivity growth has contained inflationary pressures.	Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the FOMC has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy action.

56,"December 21, 1999","For immediate releaseThe Federal Open Market Committee made no change today in its target for the federal funds rate.  Based on the available evidence, however, the Committee remains concerned with the possibility that over time increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking account of the remarkable rise in productivity growth.  Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's exemplary performance.  Nonetheless, in light of market uncertainties associated with the century date change, the Committee decided to adopt a symmetric directive in order to indicate that the focus of policy in the intermeeting period must be ensuring a smooth transition into the Year 2000.  At its next meeting the Committee will assess available information on the likely balance of supply and demand, conditions in financial markets, and the possible need for adjustment in the stance of policy to contain inflationary pressures.

57,"September 29, 1998","For immediate releaseThe Federal Open Market Committee decided today to ease the stance of monetary policy slightly, expecting the federal funds rate to decline 1/4 percentage point to around 5-1/4 percent.	The action was taken to cushion the effects on prospective economic growth in the United States of increasing weakness in foreign economies and of less accommodative financial conditions domestically.  The recent changes in the global economy and adjustments in U.S. financial markets mean that a slightly lower federal funds rate should now be consistent with keeping inflation low and sustaining economic growth going forward.

Growing caution by lenders and unsettled conditions in financial markets more generally are likely to be restraining aggregate demand in the future.

60,"March 25, 1997","For immediate release	The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to tighten money market conditions slightly, expecting the federal funds rate to rise 1/4percentage point to around 5-1/2 percent.	This action was taken in light of persisting strength in demand, which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy that would eventually undermine the long expansion.	In these circumstances, the slight firming of monetary conditions is viewed as a prudent step that affords greater assurance of prolonging the current economic expansion by sustaining the existing low inflation environment through the rest of this year and next.  The experience of the last several years has reinforced the conviction that low inflation is essential to realizing the economy's fullest growth potential.

63,"July 6, 1995","For immediate releaseChairman Alan Greenspan announced today that the Federal Open Market Committee decided to decrease slightly the degree of pressure on bank reserve positions.   As a result of the monetary tightening initiated in early 1994, inflationary pressures have receded enough to accommodate a modest adjustment in monetary conditions.

Since the last easing of monetary policy in July, inflation has been somewhat more favorable than anticipated, and this result along with an associated moderation in inflation expectations warrants a modest easing in monetary conditions.  This action is expected to be reflected in a decline in the federal funds rate of 25 basis points, from about 5 3/4 percent to about 5 1/2 percent.  "
65,"February 4, 1994","Chairman Alan Greenspan announced today that the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions. The action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term money market interest rates.   The decision was taken to move toward a less accommodative stance in monetary policy in order to sustain and enhance the economic expansion.   Chairman Greenspan decided to announce this action immediately so as to avoid any misunderstanding of the Committee's purposes, given the fact that this is the first firming of reserve market conditions by the Committee since early 1989.

The Board approved an increase in the discount rate from 3 percent to 3-1/2 percent, effective immediately, and the Federal Open Market Committee agreed that this increase should be allowed to show through completely into interest rates in reserve markets.    These actions, combined with the three adjustments initiated earlier this year by the FOMC, substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation which prevailed throughout 1993. As always, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor economic and financial developments to judge the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
